# Chewabl - Quick Dining Picks

A social dining discovery app that helps you and your friends decide where to eat. Swipe through nearby restaurants, create dining plans, and let group voting settle the "where should we eat?" debate once and for all.

Built with React Native and Expo for iOS and Android.

## Features

### Swipe to Discover
Browse nearby restaurants with a Tinder-style swipe interface. Swipe right to save, left to skip. Your preferences (cuisine, budget, dietary needs, distance) shape what you see. Powered by the Google Places API for real restaurant data based on your location.

### Group Swipe Voting
Can't agree on a restaurant? Create a group swipe session and invite friends. Everyone swipes independently, and Chewabl finds the restaurants your group agrees on. The flow moves through four phases: lobby, swiping, waiting for others, and results with match scores.

### Dining Plans
Plan ahead with structured dining events. Set a date, time, cuisine, and budget. Invite friends with RSVP tracking and deadlines. Plans support both "planned" events (pick a restaurant) and "group-swipe" sessions (vote together).

### Friends & Social
Add friends via phone contacts or unique invite codes. Manage friend requests, see mutual dining plans, and build your dining crew. Push notifications keep everyone in the loop on invites and RSVPs.

### Personalized Preferences
Onboarding captures your taste profile: favorite cuisines, budget range, dietary restrictions, preferred atmosphere, group size, and search radius. These preferences power restaurant recommendations across the app.

### Dark Mode with Chomp Transition
Toggle dark mode from your profile with a custom animated transition. Four sequential cookie-bite shapes eat away the old theme to reveal the new one, complete with scalloped edges and haptic feedback. Respects reduced-motion accessibility settings.

- Xcode (for iOS simulator) or Android Studio (for Android emulator)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jronnomo/Chewabl.git
cd Chewabl

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-backend-url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=<your-google-places-api-key>
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
```

### Running the App

```bash
# Start the backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# In another terminal — start the Expo dev server
npx expo start

# Press 'i' for iOS simulator or 'a' for Android emulator
# Or run a native build directly:
npx expo run:ios
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# TypeScript type checking (frontend)
